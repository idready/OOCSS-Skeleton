OOCSS-Skeleton
==============

Some Sass/Compass skeleton from which i usually start projetcs.
I added some HTML file from HTML5 Boilerplate ( https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate ).
I will keep it update with HTML5 Boilerplate and improve Sass/Compass skeleton.
I also added a new branch to start a project with Grunt Task Runner (check the readme-grunt file)
